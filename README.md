# dx for method counting.

always prints counts of field and method.

## vs. Android Studio APK Analyzer
You can see method references of classes.dex on "Build - Analyze APK" menu.
But, this is not available when build fails.

## Usage
Replace your .../Android/sdk/build-tools/[buildToolsVersion]/lib/dx.jar with this dx.jar(see releases).
